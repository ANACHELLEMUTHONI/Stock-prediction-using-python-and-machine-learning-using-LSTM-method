# Stock-prediction-using-python-and-machine-learning-using-LSTM-method
This is a step to step breakdown of a stock prediction project using python and machine learning. The method for prediction used is the LSTM method.

## What is the LSTM method 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, such as time series or text data. It addresses the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs, allowing them to learn and remember information over longer time periods.
## Steps taken to develop the stock market prediction

First, I perform exporatory analysis of my data. I then proceed to clean my data and fill any missing values
